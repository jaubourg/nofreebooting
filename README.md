This is the source code for [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-video-freebooting/efojlgflkaapgbbnaafginhdkfijkldb).

The extension removes videos uploaded on Facebook from your timeline.

Facebook is slow to take down illegal re-uploads and makes money in the process.

Even in case of legal content, Facebook doesn't give any ad money back to creators!

Please, only share videos from YouTube, a site that actually does give some money back to creators!
